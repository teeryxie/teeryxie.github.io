# SocialOmni leaderboard

Static English / Chinese leaderboard for GitHub Pages. Serve this directory over HTTP; the page loads `data.json` without a build step or third-party JavaScript dependencies.

All models appear in one table, initially sorted by QEns_joint. Response quality uses Gemini 3.8 Flash, Qwen3.8-Omni-Flash and GPT-5.6-Sol, including rescoring of earlier models' existing responses. Original outputs, evaluation settings, diagnostics and historical panels remain in the source repository. Model names link to their supporting results.

## Results data

- `updated_at`: publication date.
- `links`: public paper, code and dataset URLs.
- `judges`: exact model identifiers for the current scoring panel.
- `records`: model identity, source, metrics and evaluation metadata.

Metrics are `who`, `when`, `qgold`, `qens`, `cov_plus` and `qens_joint`, on a 0–100 scale. Missing values are `null`, displayed as — and sorted last in either direction. Do not fill missing values with historical judge scores. No composite score is calculated beyond the defined QEns_joint metric.

Before publishing, verify model identities, complete judge scores, source responses and evaluation settings. Keep credentials and private endpoints out of public files. Preserve historical results in the repository archive when changing the scoring panel.

## Checks

Verify both languages, all-model display, metric sorting in both directions, missing values, search and no matches, source links, keyboard navigation and mobile table scrolling.

## Media and examples

`cases.json` preserves the selected dataset annotations, public source identifiers and video hashes. Chinese translations are separate `_zh` fields; original annotations are unchanged. The two Level 2 clips end at the annotated decision time. Reference answers are initially collapsed.

`media/socialomni-introduction.mp4` is the author-provided project video, remuxed for progressive playback without re-encoding. Videos load only on interaction. Case clips use H.264 video and AAC audio.
